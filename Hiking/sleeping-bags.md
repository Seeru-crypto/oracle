**Materials** :
- Shellproof outer shell - a lightweight, hard-wearing, ripstop reinforced and specially treated polyamide which is both wind and waterproof (1000 mm), yet breathable.

- Shelltrans lining - a soft to the skin ripstop reinforced polyamide with excellent moisture-wicking capabilities keeps you comfortable through the night.

- Thermoflect, a very thin, very lightweight aluminium material that reflects body heat. Thermoflect raises the sleeping bags heat-retaining capacity by about 11 %.

- G-Loft filling - Carinthia's own, in-house "hollow-fibre", made in Austria. Highly compressible, excellent weight-insulation ratio and also moisture resistant, meaning that it will work even under long-term use in damp conditions.

- Defence 1 uses single layered, lightweight G-Loft filling. In this lightweight design, the outer shell is loosely attached to the bag.

- The G-LOFT Plus filling is quilted to an insulating scrim. As a result, an additional air pocket is formed between the quilted insulation layer and the shell, yet no cold seams can occur.

**Features** :
Two way zippers
Bag is designed to have enough space in the bottle of the bag for shoe bag or extra clothing
Designed for military purposes but luckily it isn’t so overly built that it can’t be use by civilians.
