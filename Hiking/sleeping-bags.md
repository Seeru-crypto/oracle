# Sleeping bags

Usually sleeping bags can be categorized into winter and 3 season bags, since the temp differences are so high.
When sleeping outdoors, the coldness will come from 2 general ways: from the ground and from the air. The sleeping-mat takes care of the ground and sleepingbag the air.

# Important notes!

-   When picking a bag make sure to get one that is generally your size, if you get a larger one then during the night it
    will create cold air pockets which will be unpleasent and cools you down

-   When storing for long-term, do not use compression bags, because they will shorten the bags lifespan and make it less efficent at retaining heat.

-   when camping you can not use the compress bag and just stuff the sleeping bag in you backpack. Utilizes more space,
    and is a bit more airy + easier to take out and put in.

-   After taking the bag out of the rucksak, air it! Sleeping bags retain heat a lot better if there is air between you and 'outside'.

-   to pre-warm a bag you can warm water and put a warm water bottle, inside the bag. (between your legs, due to artery
    position) OR do light excercice to warm your body up and STOP before you start sweating.

-   For a more comfortable sleep eat before going to sleep, because while your body is digesting the food, it will generate more heat, making sleep more comfortable, fattier the food the better,

-   Before going to sleep replace your socks with dry/ clean ones, it will keep them warmer.
    If you have thicker "sleeping socks", then that is preferred. because hands and toes are the first things to get cold
    because it will take more time for it to break down.

-   When sleeping in a bag, consider sleeping in clean clothes or using a inner sheet, to keep the bag
    clean.

-   During very cold nights consider using urine bottle, beacause holding it in loses body heat and going outside is
    unpleasent. Make sure you tighten the lid after using it...

-   When using a headlamp, keep it around your neck, for ease of use at night.

-   When going to sleep you can put your dry jacket / Mylar blanket inside the bag so that it will keep you warmer and won´t roll off the bag.

-   You can combine sleeping bags to raise the comfort zone, wrapping one around the other

# Heat ratings

Sleeping bags either have a 3 or 4 number heat rating system, depending on manufacturer.

1. For example (-4; -1; 1; 5) means you will survice at -4, men will be comfortable at -1 women at 1 and after 5 you
   will begin to sweat.
2. (-4; 0; 5) same extremiums but 0 is the general comfort zone

**NB** When looking for a bag, you can add +5 to all the numbers and you will get the real result. Because those numbers are achieved in perfect conditions.

# Carinthia Defence 1

-   The G-LOFT Plus filling is quilted to an insulating scrim. As a result, an additional air pocket is formed between the quilted insulation layer and the shell, yet no cold seams can occur.
