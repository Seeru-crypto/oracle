# Sleeping Mats

// foam sleeping pads

sleeping mats can be divided into 2 categories air mattresses (AM) and non-air mattress (NAM).
Usually AM´s are warmer due to the insolating air layer between user and the ground, with the drawback of being far more fragile.

You should only use NAM´s during the warmer seasons and during the colder seasons you should use both.
If the NAM has a silver side, then face it towards the user.

generaly AM´s are a lot better due to weight and warmness ratio. However they take longer to set up and are more fragile.

## Heat ratings

For matresses the heat ratings are measured by the R value, where 0 is tropical and 10 is mountaneering.

For warm season R2 is adequate, for winter around R6 is prefferable or R4 with NAM.

AM´s can be separated into self inflating and non-self inflating.

self-inflating are easier to use and slightly sturdier.

Pure air matresses are generally 2x lighter. cost wise they are similar.
