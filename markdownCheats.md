# Markdown cheats

## Desc
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents

Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isnâ€™t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.
